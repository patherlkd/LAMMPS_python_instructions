# LAMMPS_python_instructions (see relevant pdf)
Simple instructions of how I downloaded and installed python interface for LAMMPS.

There is also an example python code for a basic LAMMPS simulation using the Python interface.

## pylammpsmpi

I have added a MWE of a simple LJ fluid working with the pylammpsmpi new interface: https://github.com/pyiron/pylammpsmpi/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

An example of a resulting configuration is added to the folder.

At a later date I will write more instructions on this...
